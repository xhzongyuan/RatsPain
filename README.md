RatsPain: A Well-Labeled Image Dataset for Assessing Pain in Rats Through Facial Expressions

1. Introduction
RatsPain is a publicly available dataset specially developed for the research of pain assessment in rats through facial expressions. It consists of 1,138 facial images captured from six rats that underwent an orthodontic treatment operation. Each rat's facial images in RatsPain were carefully selected from videos recorded either before or after the operation and well labeled by eight students with the background of biomedical engineering or medicine according to the Rat Grimace Scale (RGS) [1]. Based on the RatsPain, we also provide a benchmark evaluation by using several conventional machine learning (LBP + SVM) and deep learning (ResNet-18) methods.
